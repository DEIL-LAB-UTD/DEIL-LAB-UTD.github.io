        "We are a research group in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, and led by <a href=\"https://yunhuiguo.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--accent-color); text-decoration: none;\">Dr. Yunhui Guo</a>. ",
        "Our lab develops data-efficient, reliable, and adaptive machine learning systems. We focus on building vision models that can learn continuously, adapt to shifting real-world environments, and generalize to novel scenarios without forgetting prior knowledge. Our work spans theory and large-scale evaluation, driving advances in robust and reliable learning, continual adaptation, and multimodal intelligence. Ultimately, we aim to enable trustworthy AI systems for IoT, mobile computing, robotics, and self-driving cars.",
        "We regularly publish our research findings at top-tier ML/AI/CV conferences like CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML."
